Xiaofei Hu, Ph.D., Graduated from Tokyo Institute of Technology.

He is currently conducting research in the field of visual perception using psychophysical methods and eye-tracking devices.

**Research Fields:**

1. Pupil control pathway: the effect of low-level properties of stimuli (color, spatial frequency, brightness, etc.) on the pupil and the neural pathways behind it;

2. Attention state detection: the influence of different attention states (selectivity, dispersion, persistence, etc.) on pupillary responses, and the classification of different attention states by eye movement and pupillary responses;

3. Stereo vision: especially the effect of binocular parallax on depth perception;

4. Haptic feedback: especially the design and application of vibration scenes in portable devices.
