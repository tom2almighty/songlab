title: 'Joint Action'

---
In daily life, people often need to collaborate with others to complete joint tasks, namely interpersonal collaboration. Although many studies focused on interpersonal collaboration, it is still unclear how individuals represent their own behaviors and others' actions, and how do representation affect performance during interpersonal collaboration. Therefore, based on psychophysical method, functional near infrared spectrum(fNIRS) hyper-scanning technology, and TMS technology, we revealed factors that affect collaborative performance. We found that interpersonal situation (cooperation or competition, trust or betrayal) and interpersonal relationship (distance and intimacy) influence the representation and performance during interpersonal collaboration. Furthermore, from the perspective of representation we constructed a theoretical model to explain the generation and process of interpersonal collaboration. That is, spatial, embodied and social factors affect interpersonal collaboration together. These studies are of great significance for improving interpersonal collaborative performance.
