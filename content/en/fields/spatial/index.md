title: Spatial Cognition and Navigation



---
We are in space at the moment, perceiving physical space and mental space. Spatial cognition is an individual's ability to perceive the spatial environment and manipulate and transform it. Spatial navigation is the process by which individuals move between different locations and choose appropriate paths based on their own and environmental cues. This is not only the basis for animals to adapt to the environment but also the key to human survival and adaptation. In order to explore the internal mechanism of human spatial cognition and navigation, we mainly use the virtual reality (VR) experiment platform combined with eye movement, physiological measurement, and other technologies. The exploration of human spatial cognition and navigation is of important significance to the improvement of spatial task performance in a special environment and the design of commercial navigation interfaces.
