title: 'Distance Compression in Virtual Reality'



---
With the advancement of time, virtual reality technology is also constantly developing, and more and more fields are also adding virtual reality technology to the ranks of applicable technologies, such as the education industry, medical industry and various accompanying training industries. However, virtual reality technology still has shortcomings. For example, the distance perception in the virtual environment is not as accurate as the distance perception in the real environment. And this phenomenon that we underestimate the distance for long distances in the virtual environment is called the space compression phenomenon. Through the psychophysical method, we provided the subjects with inconsistent visual cues and auditory cues to allow the subjects to judge their perceived distance. This method effectively alleviates the space compression phenomenon in virtual reality.
