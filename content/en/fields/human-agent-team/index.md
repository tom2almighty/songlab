title: 'Human-Agent Teaming'

---

With the development of artificial intelligence technology, an increasing number of people interact with intelligent agents (including intelligent robots and intelligent machine systems) in work and life situations. For example, drivers rely on intelligent navigation system to complete driving tasks, while pilots use the autopilot system to reduce burden of tasks. Human-agent relationship in these days has gradually become a new kind of partnership, which brings considerations to the research and application in the area of human factors. Noticeable, the impact of a failure in human-agent collaboration could be catastrophic. Therefore, by creating human-machine cooperation situation via virtual reality technology, we aim to discuss how to improve the collaborative performance in the teamwork between humans and agents, so as to improve the safety during the process of human-agent collaboration.
