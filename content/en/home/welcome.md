The Intelligent Interaction and Virtual Reality Laboratory of Shaanxi Normal University was established in 2022 by Professor Xiaolei Song. The lab mainly uses virtual reality technology, fNIRS, TMS, and eye-tracking to study the spatial, embodied and social cognitive and neural mechanisms of individuals in tasks such as spatial cognition and navigation, and collaborative operations.We also conduct research in cognitive and neural ergonomic enhancement, human-computer interface design, intelligent human-computer interaction, and collaborative teams of humans and intelligent agents. Welcome to join our team!
