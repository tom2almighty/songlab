abstract: "The Joint Simon Effect(JSE)is a spatial stimulus-response compatibility effect that appears when two participants complete complementarycomponents of a standard Simon task.The effect is considered as a valid index of the degree of self-other integration.Two main factors can influence theeffect:social and nonsocial factors.Researchers explain JSE through the social facilitation theory,the co-representation account,the spatial response coding theory and the referential coding account.Future work on JSE should further explore the factors that influence it and the underlying brain mechanism,and further investigate its theoretical underpinnings."
