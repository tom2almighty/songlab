abstract: "To systematically analyze the underlying mechanism of spatial orientation ability under different environments and review the application adv
ances,the measurement study and application of two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial orientation ability in normal environment,as well as the spatial disorientation and training in special environment from the perspective of spatial dimension were introduced.Then the reference principle hypothesis,the spatial representation strategy theory,the spatial compatibility theory and sensory conflict theory under different conditions were sorted out.Finally,from the aspects of influencing factors,task paradigms and research methods,some ideas and enlightment for the training and improvement of space orientation ability were put forward."
