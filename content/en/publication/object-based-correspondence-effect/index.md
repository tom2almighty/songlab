abstract: "The object-based correspondence effect(also called object-based Simon effect),is a special spatial correspondence effect,which refers to the phenomenon thatresponses are faster and more accurate when a handle of the graspable object and the response position or the responding hand are consistent than inconsistent.Tucker and Elly activated by the handle is consistent that required by the task,responses are faster.In addition to the functional affordance,many researchers have also used the spatial pos1 the frying pan was located at the center of the screen,participants were asked to judge the stimulus to be upright or inverted,and responded with the responding hand.The aim of it was to examine whether the silhouettes and photographs of the frying pan would exist the object-based correspondence effect without significant spatial position.In Expehen spatial location of the stimulus was not significant for silhouette stimuli,but not photograph stimuli.In Experiment 2 when the spatial position of the stimuli was more significant,silhouette and photograph stimuli both showed the correspondence effect and the effect size was similar.The RT combined analysis of Experiment 1 and 2 suggested that tand photograph stimuli.Based on these results,it is concluded that the spatial coding hypothesis plays an important role in the generation of the object-based correspondenceeffect during a two key-pressing selection task,the affordance coding or other explanations are much smaller than that."
