abstract: "Abstract:This research adopted the task interference experimental paradigm in exploring the relationship between stimulus spatial location and response result in order to infer the functional mechanism of the Simon effect and its reversal.The results indicate that the reversal of the Simon effect occured when colored stimuli were centered and tones occured in the left or right ear.It is suggested that,displaycontrol arrangement correspondence was the primary cause of the reversal of the Simon effect with logical recoding playing only a secondary role."
