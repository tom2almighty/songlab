abstract: "Distance compression in virtual reality (VR),which will lead to a distortion of fine manipulation inpractical application,depicts that people tend to underestimate the spatial distance of visual stimuli in virtualenvironments.The apparent perceived differences between virtual and real environments break the immersiveexperiences and lower users'acceptance.Therefore,it is crucial to ameliorate the distance compression toincrease the fidelity and ultimately promote the wider application of VR.Capitalizing on the fact that distancecompression is a multiple modality phenomenon and occurs for auditory and visual stimuli,researchers reportedthat the distance judgment in VR would get more accurate when the positions of auditory and visual stimuli wereincongruent.However,it is unclear to what extent the incongruency is to get effective amelioration.In this study,we aimed to completely examine the effect of the auditory stimulus on distance compression in VR.Wepresumed that the larger the incongruency was,the better amelioration obtained.We used the HTC Vive Pro to render the virtual environment and the build-in headphone to present auditorystimulus.Thirty participants were recruited to perform a distance judgment task.We first controlled the presence or absence of the auditory stimulus.We also varied the egocentric distance of visual stimulus (3 m,4 m,5 m)Then,we controlled the incongruency of the audio-visual condition,that is,the exocentric distance betweenauditory and visual stimuli (0.5 m,1 m,1.5 m,2 m).Each block consisted of 30 consecutive trials,wherein thereference visual stimulus was presented at the beginning 5 s.Participants were asked to judge whether thefollowing adjust stimulus was nearer or farther than the reference stimulus.The egocentric distance would beadjusted according to the response of the prior trial.The egocentric distance of the adjust stimulus in the lasttrial was referred to as the ultimate distance judgment for the initial reference stimulus.We found that the auditory stimulus affected the distance compression in two ways.First,the distancecompression under the audio-visual condition was smaller than that under the visual-only condition (F(1,29)=4.05,p 0.054,np 0.12),especially when the egocentric distance of the visual stimulus was large (4 m:difference 1.8%,t =-1.59,df=29,p 0.062;5 m:difference 1.6%,t=-1.85,df=29,p 0.037).Second,we formulated the relationship between the exocentric distance between auditory and visual stimuli and thedistance compression rate,which was calculated by subtracting the perceived egocentric distance from thephysical egocentric distance and then dividing it by the physical egocentric distance.:distance compression rate-0.024 x exocentric distance +0.056.The slope was significant (p=0.008),indicating the distance compressionrate was negatively correlated with the exocentric distance and could be ameliorated at a pace of 2.4%for every1 m.The adjusted R was 90.7%.We reported the effect of auditory stimulus on the distance compression in VR.Based on our results,wehighly recommended presenting the auditory and visual stimuli simultaneously in the time domain and aminimum of 1 m apart in the space domain to ameliorate the distance compression in VR."
