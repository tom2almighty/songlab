abstract: "Visual mental image generation had been defined as the process by which long-term memory knowledge of the visual appearance of objects or scenes is used tmage generation process?What roles that both hemispheres played in image generation process?All these questions needed to be explored again.Using two tasks dissociatedparadigm developed by Kosslyn,three behavior experiments were conducted to reveal the Hemispheric Specialization during visual image generation process.Seventy two right-handed undergraduates (aged between 19 and 21)took part in the experiments.In three experiments,a classical image generation task was adopted to investigate the cognitivehe onset of the participants'response)and error rates were recorded and analyzed.The aim of these experiments was to clarify the different roles of two hemispheres in generaects required less time when the stimuli were presented initially to the left hemisphere,which was as expected if categorical spatial relations were used to arrange segments intometric positions to arrange parts,and was more effective in the right cerebral hemisphere.The present results suggested that visual mental images could be generated by eitherthe left or right cerebral hemisphere,but in different ways.The left hemisphere more effectively generated images by arranging parts according to descriptions(using categoricalspatial relations),whereas the right hemisphere more effectively generated images by positioning parts in precise locations in space(using coordinate spatial relations)."
