abstract: "The work aims to discuss the neuroergonomics mechanism,influence and promotion of collaborative performance in two-person collaborative tasks from the perspective of neuroergonomics.Literature investigation and deep analysis were used to analyze relevant literatures in different fields such as neuro-human factors,neuroergonomics,human-computer interaction and brain-computer interface.Firstly,performance research techniques and methods in the field of neuroergonomics were systematically sorted out.Secondly,the performance and its neural mechanism in joint action tasks were discussed from the perspective of neuroergonomics.Thirdly,on this basis,the influencing factors of joint action performance and ways to enhance and promote issues were further clarified.Finally,ways to apply the result of collaborative performance above to the field of intelligent human-computer interaction in the future were summarized.The study of collaborative performance in joint action tasks from the perspective of neuroergonomics is helpful to understand the effect of interpersonal representations between operators on collaboration and teaming in human-machine collaborative or teaming operations.The results can be directly applied to the design and optimization of the collaborative operation system,especially the design and optimization of the intelligent agent in the future,to meet the needs of collaborative operation design in many complex human-machine systems,and provide scientific basis for the establishment of an interactive model of natural and efficient collaborative operation."
