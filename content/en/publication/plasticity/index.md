abstract: "Visual mental image generation had been defined as the process during which long-term memory knowledge of the visualappearance of objects or scenes is used to create a short-term percept-like image.It is a complex and multi-componential cognitiveprocess,and a most basic process in visual mental image processs.A systematic research on it will help us not only deeply understandthe law of human visual mental image processing,but also most effectively exame and evaluate visual spatial cognition functional levelin practice.Does functional plasticity really exist in visual mental image generation process?What roles do both hemispheres play inimage generation process?All these questions need to be explored again.The present study adopted a standardized image generation task to examine the cognitive plasticity in the visual image generatingprocess.Two experiments were conducted to test the processing level of image generating respectively in systematically trained collegestudents and children of three different age phases.In two experiments,a classical image generation task was adopted to investigatethe cognitive plasticity of simple letter image generation.The subjects were cued to form images within a grid or within a set of fourcorner brackets;a single X mark was enclosed within each stimulus,and the subjects were to determine whether the X mark wouldhave fallen on an imaged pattern.To ensure that participants mentally generated the target letter,probe location was varied.'Early'probes appeared on letter segments that were first produced when the letter was drawn;while'late'probes appeared on later producedsegments.The reaction time (measured from the end of the question to the onset of the participants'response)and error rates wererecorded and analyzed.The aim of these experiments was to clarify whether functional plasticity really existed in visual mental imagegeneration process.
We obtained some evidence by having the subjects memorize letters in grids (which were easily encoded using descriptions of thepositions of segments)or within a space delineated by four brackets (which required memorizing the precise positions of thesegments).In Experiment 1,we found evidence that the grid task elicited a left hemisphere categorical strategy;while the brackettask elicited a right hemisphere 'coordinate'strategy.And it was shown that the visual image generation level changed after a long-term systemic training,and some degree of practice effect was found.In Experiment 2,the results revealed the significant andcomplex effects of probe location on categorical and coordinate image generation abilities.Specifically,early probes elicited a strongright hemisphere advantage for both tasks across all ages,whereas late probes produced a left hemisphere dissociation betweencategorical and coordinate processing.The left hemisphere dissociation was evident only for 10-year-olds and 14-year-olds,suggestingthat young children are not yet proficient in generating spatial representations.The present results suggested that the visual image generation level revealed some changes after the long-term systematic trainingor age factors influenced,showed some extent of practice effect and age effcct,which indicated younger children are not yet proficientin generating spatial representations.nine or so perhaps is the critical period in children's development of spatial representations orcategorical image generation abilities,and the highest functional plasticity period that individuals'visual image generation processinginfluenced by some hereditary and intrinsic attributes of the cerebral nervous anatomic structure,the processing system of visual imagegenerating showed a relatively high cognitive plasticity and susceptibility"
