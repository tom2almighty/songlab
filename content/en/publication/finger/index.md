abstract: "Numerous studies have shown that finger counting habits have some influences on number processing performance.There are two different finger configurationng representation,which automatically activate number semantics.Whereas noncanonical configurations belongs to summation coding,which activates number perceptual level.Under the Chinese culture context,the finger numeral representation has its special connotation,especially the representations of larger numbers.In order to clarify the peculiarsponse Box and an external microphone device.The experimental procedure was as follows:at each trial,the 500 millisecond fixation point was presented at first.Then a 49 milliollowed by the same 49 millisecond masking stimulus.Finally,the target stimulus (Arabic number)was presented for 1500 milliseconds,and the subject was required to verballyreport the presented number as quickly as possible while ensuring correctness.In Experiment 2,as canonical configurations,Chinese finger numerical representations was used.The purpose of this experiment was to further investigate the influences of different configurations of both hands on the large number(5~9)of cognitive processing.The resultong main distance effect for both the left and right sides of the regression line,which suggested the activation of a place coding representation,and it showed semantic features.For non-canonical configurations,we found a distance effect only for the right side of the regression line when targets were larger than primes,but a flat distance effect for thete the influence of the finger number configurations on the number recognition in Chinese cultural context.The results above support the embodied numerosity theory as well asthe computational model."
