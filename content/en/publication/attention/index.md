abstract: Previous studies show that the amplitude of pupillary light response (PLR) depends on the corneal flux density (CFD), which is the product of stimulus area by luminance. However, the contribution of CFD has been investigated only when the stimulus was centered on the fovea, whereas perceived luminance to pupillary response would reduce with stimulus eccentricity. Additionally, it has been shown recently that attentional state modulates pupillary response. In this study, we aimed to clarify the complete mechanisms of PLR by manipulating the stimulus size, eccentricity, luminance, and the participantsâ€™ attentional states. We focused on four indices to examine PLR, that is, pupillary latency (PL), maximum constriction velocity (MCV), maximum constriction (MC), and mean pupil change (MPC). Results showed that PL was a function of CFD, whereas MCV, MC, and MPC were functions of both CFD and stimulus eccentricity. Furthermore, the magnitude of effect due to stimulus eccentricity for MCV and MC was different from that for MPC. These results provided new evidence that the different processing systems in PLR existed.
