abstract: "Joint Simon effect is used as an effective indicator to examine the co-representation ability for young children.The paradigm of joint Simon task was adopted in the two experiments to explore the development of young children'joint Simon effect and the influence mechanism of interpersonal situations on the effect.The experiment1,with three age grades from 3 to 5 participated in,was designed to investigate the development of joint Simon effectfor young children in order to reveal the development trends of their co-representation ability.Based on the experiment 1,the experiment 2,taking five-year-old children with stable joint Simon effect as the participants,was designed to further examine whether different interpersonal situations would modulatethe children 's joint Simon effect and what mechanism concealed behind it.The above two experiments indicated that,first,compared to three-year-old chiIdren,four-year-old children begin to appear the joint Simon effect but still unstable,and the effect for five-year-old children reaches a more stable level;second,young children's co-representation ability can be influenced by interpersonal situations,and contrasted with the cooperative situation,the ability oftheir joint action is refrained in the competitive situation.The results of this study,therefore,strongly support the referential coding theory and also broaden the understanding of the co-representation theory."
