abstract: "Spatial Simon effect reflects the preference of spatial congruence of stimulus and response location on the information processing when participants respond togm variants were used and participants were also asked to carry on a standard Simon task under the vocal response conditions,in order to verify the existence of the spatial Simon effect.Similar to experiment 1,except the stimuli were changed to some brief strokes of facial emotional pictures,experiment 2 was to examine whether irrelevant emotionpatial Simon effect.The dependent variables,across all the above experiments,are the response time and accuracy rate.As a result,the experiment 1 confirmed the existenceicit the role of the association of good/right and bad/left and polarity coding correspondence,we conducted a combination analysis of 2(space/valence mapping:mapping,un-mapping)x 2(emotional valence:positive,negative)x 2(correspondence:correspondence,non-correspondence),the result showed that,in the mapping group,the correspondepondence theory,and also partially in consistent with the body-specificity hypothesis."
