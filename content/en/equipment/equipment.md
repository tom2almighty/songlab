      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Functional near-infrared spectroscopy</h5>
      fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain responses by recording changes in the amount of oxygenated/deoxygenated blood. It works based on the principle of light scattering â€“ the device sends high intensity beams of near-infrared light at the scalp and detects changes to amount of light absorbed within the brain. Mathematical algorithms are then applied to process the collected data to calculate changes in oxygenated/deoxygenated haemoglobin concentration. These changes are associated with changes in brain function.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator(TMS)</h5>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation technology uses pulsed magnetic fields to act on the central nervous system (mainly the brain) to change the membrane potential of cortical nerve cells, causing them to generate induced currents, affecting brain metabolism and neural electrical activity, thereby causing a series of physiological and biochemical reactions.
